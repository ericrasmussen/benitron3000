## Quatronaut 2020

A work-in-progress robotron style game made using https://amethyst.rs.

### Quick Build and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericrasmussen/quatronaut2020.git
cd quatronaut2020
cargo xtask run
```

### Gameplay notes

This game is for fun and mostly exists to show off rust and amethyst. I am not an
accomplished game developer, and this is being developed as a learning exercise.
But, it works! Kind of! Feel free to use any of the code for your own rust and amethyst
games.

The controls are wasd for movement and the arrow keys for firing lasers.

### Triple A Features

- immersive sound effects
- a rockin' chiptunes track
- polygonal action with more than one shape
- it's sort of like Robotron but not
- surprise transition and advanced camera work that changes EVERYTHING
- it's technically possible to win. I did it once
- working menu screens! kind of! ...sometimes
- will be shipped ahead of schedule with lots of bugs
