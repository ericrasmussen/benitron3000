## Quatronaut 2020

A work-in-progress robotron style game made using https://amethyst.rs.

### Quick Build and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericrasmussen/quatronaut2020.git
cd quatronaut2020
cargo xtask run
```

### Gameplay notes

This game is pre-pre-pre-alpha and is being developed as a learning exercise.

The controls are wasd for movement and the arrow keys for firing lasers.

The game supports many experimental features, including being able to walk offscreen for infinity, perhaps never to return. Several of these highly advanced gameplay mechanics and features may be adjusted as development progresses, with the goal of eventually resembling an actual game.
